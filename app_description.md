WhereTF.ai – Your AI-Powered Memory for Lost Items
Overview
WhereTF.ai is an AI-powered personal and business inventory tracking app that helps users instantly locate misplaced items using voice commands, text searches, and image recognition. Whether you’re constantly misplacing your keys at home or managing tools and inventory in a shop, WhereTF.ai ensures you never waste time searching again.

With a combination of natural language processing (NLP), vector search, AI-powered predictions, and image-based object recognition, WhereTF.ai acts as a personal memory assistant, keeping track of where you store your items and intelligently predicting where they might be.

Key Features
🔍 AI-Powered Search (Text & Voice)
Simply type or ask: “Where’d my 3/8 socket set go?” and get an instant answer.
Uses OpenAI’s GPT-4o for natural language understanding.
Supports voice commands, making it perfect for hands-free searching.
📸 Image-Based Search & Object Recognition
Take a photo of an item, and WhereTF.ai identifies and stores it for future searches.
Uses OpenAI’s CLIP & Semantic Segment Anything (SSA) for precise object detection.
If you forget the name of an object, just upload a photo of something similar, and AI will match it.
📍 Location Hierarchy & Structured Storage
Organize storage in a hierarchical system:
Rooms → (Garage, Office, Kitchen)
Containers → (Toolbox, Cabinet, Shelf)
Compartments → (Top Drawer, Bottom Right Section)
AI remembers every placement, so even if you vaguely remember storing something in “the workshop,” it can suggest precise locations.
🧠 Behavioral Tracking & Smart Predictions
AI learns your storage habits over time and suggests likely locations based on your past behavior.
Example: If you frequently store measuring tape in the toolbox, but one day you leave it on the workbench, WhereTF.ai predicts where you last had it.
Uses historical location data to improve accuracy over time.
🔄 Real-Time Object Movement Tracking
Whenever you move an item, AI logs the movement in its database.
Example: “You last moved the screwdriver from the toolbox to the workbench two days ago.”
Keeps a time-stamped history of where an item has been stored.
🛠 For Home & Business Use
For Households: Track everyday items like keys, remote controls, phone chargers, wallets, or tools.
For Businesses & Shops: Perfect for inventory tracking, tool management, and warehouse organization.
For Workshop Owners & Mechanics: Never lose a specialty wrench or socket set again.
🚀 Instant AI-Powered Object Recovery
If you can’t find something, WhereTF.ai makes an educated guess about where it might be.
Uses GPT-4o predictions, combined with past movement history, to suggest the most probable location.
Example: “Your measuring tape was last seen in the garage, but you often leave it in the kitchen drawer—check there too.”
📊 Detailed Storage Reports & Insights
Get reports on your most frequently misplaced items.
AI provides insights into your storage patterns and helps optimize organization.
How It Works
1️⃣ Store Your Items
Use text, voice, or images to log an item in WhereTF.ai.
AI categorizes the item and assigns it a location (e.g., “Screwdriver → Red Toolbox → Second Drawer”).
2️⃣ Search for an Item
Use natural language search:
“Where’s my tape measure?” → AI returns: “Top drawer in the workshop.”
Use image search:
Upload a photo of a tool, and AI finds it in your storage.
Voice search allows you to simply ask out loud where something is.
3️⃣ AI Predicts Locations if an Item is Missing
If AI can’t find an exact match, it suggests the most probable location based on your past storage habits.
Example: “Your hammer isn’t logged, but you usually keep it in the garage.”
4️⃣ Track Movement & History
AI keeps historical records of where you last moved an item.
If something was recently relocated, AI lets you know when and where it was last stored.
